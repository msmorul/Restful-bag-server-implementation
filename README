The bag ingestion tools contain several client and server side components. 
 - ace-am-lib - ACE audit manager api, used by older collection managers.
 - bag-client - bag client library used to query RESTful bag services
 - bag-exe - standalone server to share a directory of bags
 - bag-manager - Simple UI to share a directory of bags
 - bag-services - RESTful bag services to be integrated into other apps
 - bag-storage-library - Core bag storage api used by the rest-ful bag services
 - CollectionManager - Client UI for ingesting ang browsing bags on a bag server.

----
Compiling

 This project was build using maven 3.0.1 running against jdk 1.6. To compile
all packages, run 'mvn clean package' from the root directory. Artifacts will 
be generated which you can embed in your applications or use as standalone 
services. 
 
----
Starting the Server UI

 Look in bag-manager/target for the bag-manager...with-dependencies.jar file. 
This is a standalone binary which wraps a server.

$ java -jar bag-manager-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
Go to File->Choose Directory and select a directory to how your bag repo, or
select an existing repo. Next, make sure the port is set to the one you want
to run your server on and click Server->Start Server.

You now have a running bag server on http://localhost:[port]/bags

----
Starting the command line server

 Look in bag-exe/target for the bag-exe...with-dependencies.jar file. This is 
a standalone binary which can serve a bag directory by running:

 $ java -jar bag-exe-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -dir /tmp/bagdir

it will startup a bag endpoint on http://localhost:8080/bags

You can supply a -port option to change the default (8080) port.

----
Starting the Client UI

 Look in CollectionMananger/target for the collection-manager...with-dependencies.jar.
This is a standalone binary which you can start up from the command line.

 $ java -jar collection-manager-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

By default, it will look at http://localhost:8080/bags for a bag endpoint. If you are
running on a different server, you set jnlp.ingest.url to point at your bag server

 $ java -D'jnlp.ingest.url=http://mybagserver.com:8080/bags' \
   -jar collection-manager-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
